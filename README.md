# Portfolio Website

My single-page, dynamic portfolio website. The content is loaded from a JavaScript configuration file, allowing updates without altering the HTML structure.

## Technical Implementation

The portfolio operates using client-side JavaScript to build the page dynamically.

*   **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that provides the basic structure and layout for the portfolio. It includes placeholders for content that will be populated by JavaScript, and links to the stylesheet.

*   **`config.js`**: This file acts as a centralized database for the portfolio's content. It contains a single configuration object (`portfolioConfig`) where all personal data is stored, including:
    *   Profile information (name, tagline, description, social links).
    *   Lists of technical skills and featured projects.

*   **`script.js`**: This script runs when the DOM is fully loaded. It reads the `portfolioConfig` object from `config.js` and injects the data into the appropriate elements in `index.html`. It dynamically creates the skill badges and project cards based on the arrays defined in the configuration.

*    **`src/input.css`**: The development stylesheet, only imports Tailwind.

*    **`src/output.css`**: The compiled stylesheet, generated by the Tailwind CLI.

## How to Use

1.  **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install Tailwind CSS and its CLI.
2.  **Build CSS**: Run `npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css` to build the CSS file. For automatic rebuilding on changes, use `npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch`.
3.  **Edit `config.js`**: Open the `config.js` file and modify the values within the `portfolioConfig` object to reflect your own information, projects, and skills.
4.  **Update Assets**: Replace the images in the `assets/` directory (`profile.png`, `favicon.png` and project pictures) with your own.
5.  **Open `index.html`**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see your customized portfolio.
